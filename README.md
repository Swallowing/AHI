This program can detect AHI which is the number of apneas or hypopneas recorded during the study per hour of sleep. 
It is generally expressed as the number of events per hour. Based on the AHI, the severity of 
OSA is classified as follows:

None/Minimal: AHI < 5 per hour
Mild: AHI = 5, but < 15 per hour
Moderate: AHI = 15, but < 30 per hour
Severe: AHI = 30 per hour
